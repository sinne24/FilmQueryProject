# Film Query Application

### Description
The film query application allows the user to query the local database for films from the streamlined perspective of a java program. Upon initialization the user is met with a menu of three options. First the user may choose to query the database for films using film id numbers, second the user may query the database for films using keywords, and thirdly the user may quit the program. The application will continue running and prompting the user for queries until the user chooses to quit.     

### Tech Used
 Eclipse IDE, Maven, mysql, MAMP

### Things Learned
  - Critical thinking & synthesis of available resources: Much of this weekend's work was predicated on understanding how to query the mysql database and combining it with prior knowledge coding java in eclipse. If unsure how to proceed, one had to be capable of sifting through the available courseware and processing that information. Learning through reading isn't always an easy task, and this weekend's assignment forced us to stretch those muscles.
  - Debugging tactics reinforcement: Because the nature of querying a database is a language in its own right, debugging this weekend took place across three platforms to dig up root causes of bugs. In a way, it made debugging easier because there were more sanity checks available. On the other hand, It could feel cumbersome jumping between atom, sql, and eclipse to track down where syntactical errors occurred.
  - Understanding the interactions between separate technologies: To caveat on the previous bullets, this weekend's assignment and its nuances forced one to understand the interactions between separate technologies which are dependent on each other to function properly. Given this was my first exposure to programming of this kind, the practice left me feeling significantly better informed and confident in my comprehension of the materials.
  - SQL Queries - Predicates and Functions drills: At the foundation of functionality, the core component that must be accurately compiled for this weekend's program are the predicate query statements. Without that the rest would fail. This program reinforced the synthesis of those statements, and I feel I better understand how to implement them and debug my own statements.
